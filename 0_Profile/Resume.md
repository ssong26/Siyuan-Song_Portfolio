## **ENGINEERING EXPERIENCE**

### **Brown University — Postdoctoral Researcher**  
*Mar 2023 – Present*

#### **Precision Nano-Indentation Instrument Development**
- Designed a high-precision nano-indentation instrument: mechanical structure, stiffness optimization, sensor–actuator integration, vibration control.  
- Performed nonlinear/static FEA (Abaqus) for stiffness tuning, stress distribution, buckling resistance, and tolerance sensitivity.  
- Built prototypes and machined components for rapid iteration under tight performance constraints.  
- Achieved sub-nanometer displacement resolution via optimized alignment, calibration, and DAQ integration.

#### **Thin-Film Stress, Warpage & Interface Mechanics**
- Fabricated multilayer stacks (Si / Cr / Cu via PVD, Li via evaporation).  
- Characterized thermal curvature using MOSS & Zygo interferometry across temperature cycles.  
- Modeled thermo-mechanical mismatch & residual stress via COMSOL/Abaqus.  
- Extracted design rules for improving interface bonding uniformity in semiconductor-style stacks.

#### **Impact Mechanics + FEM Subroutines + ML Automation**
- Built explicit dynamic impact simulations (Abaqus/Explicit).  
- Implemented VUMAT and cohesive interface laws to capture rate-dependent damage.  
- Automated large FEM parameter sweeps entirely with Python.  
- Developed ML surrogate models to accelerate mechanical design iteration.
