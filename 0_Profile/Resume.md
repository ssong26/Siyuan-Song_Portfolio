🔬 ENGINEERING EXPERIENCE
Brown University — Postdoctoral Researcher

Mar 2023 – Present

Precision Nano-Indentation Instrument (Full-cycle Engineering)

Designed a precision nano-indentation instrument: mechanism design, load-train stiffness tuning, actuator/sensor integration, vibration isolation, calibration workflows.

Conducted nonlinear/static FEA (Abaqus) for stiffness, stress limits, buckling resistance, and tolerance optimization.

Built rapid prototypes + machined components to iterate multiple versions under tight constraints.

Integrated DAQ, control electronics, and optical alignment achieving sub-nanometer displacement resolution.

Thin-Film Stress, Warpage & Interface Mechanics (Semiconductor / Battery Relevance)

Fabricated multilayer thin-film stacks (Si/Cr/Cu via PVD/Sputtering; Li via evaporation).

Measured CTE-mismatch warpage using MOSS & Zygo interferometry, extracting curvature maps across thermal cycles.

Conducted thermal-mechanical FE calibration, correlating simulations with warpage data to validate reliability models.

Generated design rules reducing residual stress & nonuniform bonding for improved thin-film reliability.

Dynamic Impact + Subroutine-Driven Simulation + ML Automation

Built high-rate impact simulation frameworks (Abaqus Explicit, hyperelastic materials, cohesive-zone fracture).

Developed VUMAT / VUINTER user subroutines to model rate-dependent failure.

Automated parameter sweeps and data extraction using Python + Abaqus scripting.

Built ML surrogate models for simulation–experiment correlation and rapid design exploration.

Brown University — PhD Researcher, Solid Mechanics

Jun 2018 – Feb 2023

Performed 2D-material transfer (Cu etch, RCA cleaning, plasma activation) for nano-architectures.

Modeled wrinkling/crease instability (Abaqus) relevant to thin-film warpage.

Developed visco-plastic inverse solver for high-rate plate-impact experiments.
